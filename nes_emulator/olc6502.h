	// Addressing Modes =============================================
	// The 6502 has a variety of addressing modes to access data in 
	// memory, some of which are direct and some are indirect (like
	// pointers in C++). Each opcode contains information about which
	// addressing mode should be employed to facilitate the 
	// instruction, in regards to where it reads/writes the data it
	// uses. The address mode changes the number of bytes that
	// makes up the full instruction, so we implement addressing
	// before executing the instruction, to make sure the program
	// counter is at the correct location, the instruction is
	// primed with the addresses it needs, and the number of clock
	// cycles the instruction requires is calculated. These functions
	// may adjust the number of cycles required depending upon where
	// and how the memory is accessed, so they return the required
	// adjustment.

	// Opcodes ======================================================
	// There are 56 "legitimate" opcodes provided by the 6502 CPU. I
	// have not modelled "unofficial" opcodes. As each opcode is 
	// defined by 1 byte, there are potentially 256 possible codes.
	// Codes are not used in a "switch case" style on a processor,
	// instead they are repsonisble for switching individual parts of
	// CPU circuits on and off. The opcodes listed here are official, 
	// meaning that the functionality of the chip when provided with
	// these codes is as the developers intended it to be. Unofficial
	// codes will of course also influence the CPU circuitry in 
	// interesting ways, and can be exploited to gain additional
	// functionality!
	//
	// These functions return 0 normally, but some are capable of
	// requiring more clock cycles when executed under certain
	// conditions combined with certain addressing modes. If that is 
	// the case, they return 1.
	//
	// I have included detailed explanations of each function in 
	// the class implementation file. Note they are listed in
	// alphabetical order here for ease of finding.
